The x86 folder is related to the assembly code exercises of the Intel x86 processor. This is a folder of 4 asm files, the first of which is related to the implementation of four main operations on two inputs and displaying the output of those two. The second file works in such a way that it first takes an input number and then takes the same number from the user and finally it should be able to display those numbers in reverse order. The third file first takes an input number from the user. And then it checks Goldbach's conjecture for numbers less equal to that number. The output of the code includes all the even numbers along with the first two numbers that have a total equal to that corresponding even number. And finally, the fourth file first inputs a number from the user. and then it takes two input numbers for that number in each line, and the output should display the largest common divisor and the smallest common multiple corresponding to the numbers in that line in each line. The IBM folder contains the same questions for this company's processor. The project contains a file that performs four basic operations for large numbers.
